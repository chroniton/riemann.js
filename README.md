# riemann.js

This library provides a bare-bones implementation of some complex math,
particularly an implementation of the Riemann Zeta function.

It also implements a colorwheel chart generator, which can create some very
pretty wallpapers (see examples/).

## Accuracy

JavaScript isn't exactly great for math, but the accuracy of this library is
sufficient to provide faithful renderings of the zeta function, provided the
real input is greater than about -18.

## TODO

More docs and examples.
Other special functions.
Handle multi-valued complex functions properly.
Add a quaternion implementation.
Browser testing.
